## E-Commerce app

E-Commerce is rocking both on the web and mobile and we canâ€™t ignore the massive size of this industry. Knowing how to build and maintain e-commerce apps is going to help you a lot as a developer.

Key requirements and features:

**Product Management:**
Product Model: Define a schema for products including fields like name, description, price, quantity, reviews, rating and category.
CRUD Operations: Implement CRUD operation (get all products, get product by id, create product, update product, delete product) for managing products in the database.
Search Functionality: Enable search functionality to allow users to find products based on name and category (add this functionality via query params).
Product Reviews: Implement a system for users to leave reviews and ratings for products.
